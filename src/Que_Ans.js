        questions: "What is React?",
        answers: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React emphasizes declarative programming and component-based architecture.",
    },

        questions: "What are components in React?",
        answers: "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently. Components can be class-based or function-based, and they can accept inputs (props) and manage their own state.",
    },

        questions: "What are hooks in React?",
        answers: "Hooks are functions that let you 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features from function components. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, and useRef.",
    },

        questions: "What is JSX?",
        answers: "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and understand component structures. JSX is compiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel.",

        questions: "How does the virtual DOM work in React?",
        answers: "The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained in memory. When a component's state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree. React then compares this new tree with the previous virtual DOM tree using a process called 'reconciliation.' Only the differences are updated in the actual DOM, which makes updates more efficient.",
    },
